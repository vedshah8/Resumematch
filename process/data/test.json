This workshop was the first workshop of a 4-part series\nworkshop that was targeted to help university students across the globe learn\nSmart Contracts Development and build on the ICE blockchain. The series\nwas organized by the Mousebelt team in co-ordination with ICONOsphere.\nThe two workshops I conducted during the time are listed below:\nWorkshop: Build a Simple DEX on ICE\n- March 25, 2022: University of Minnesota, Minnesota\n- April 19, 2022: Combined group of students from various universities in\nThailand\nBlockchain Developer [R&D]\nJanuary 2021 - March 2022 (1 year 3 months)\nKathmandu, B\u0101gmat\u012b, Nepal\nDuring my time at Ibriz, I got the opportunity to contribute to massivelysuccessful projects like Crazy Defense Heroes (Polygon blockchain),\nPage 1 of 2\n\fGangstabet (ICON blockchain) alongside numerous significant projects as a\nSmart-contracts focused RnD Blockchain Engineer.\nMy work mostly consisted of building efficient PoCs for projects built on\ntop of the Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains ( Polygon ) and\nnon-EVM blockchains like ICON and ICE ( An in-production Substratebased blockchain). I got to contribute by writing numerous smart contracts,\nresearching cutting-edge developments in the field, and integrating best\npractices for gas-optimisations, security-vulnerzbility assessments and utility\ntools to the Smart Contracts. I'd also assist other internal teams (frontend and\nbackend) in integrating the smart contracts with the DApp.\nMy main takeaway from Ibriz was the extensive knowledge I obtained out of\nbuilding blockchain projects, most notably NFTs and Games from scratch to\nproduction alongside a talented team.\niBriz.ai\nBlockchain Developer\nMay 2020 - July 2020 (3 months)\nEducation\nKathmandu University (KU)\nB.Sc., Computer Science \u00b7 (November 2017 - June 2022)\nAmarsingh Higher Secondary School, Pokhara\n+2, Science \u00b7 (2015 - 2017)\nGandaki Boarding School\nSLC, Science \u00b7 (2008 - 2015)\nPage 2 of 2\n\f\n",
