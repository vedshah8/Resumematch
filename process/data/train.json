The power of the internet and the communities it\nprovides fascinate me.\nI got into development because computers have always fascinated\nme. Just seeing code being converted into things we use regularly,\nlike Facebook or Instagram or Google, is nothing less than magic to\nme and that's where my quest to invent began.\nI got into python because of the way it can be used in every field.\nHow it can be used a tweaked to help people in each and every field,\nhow it is easy to get into, but hard to master,  made me select it as\nmy main programming language. \nThe world is powered by data, each and everything runs on it. The\nway small bits of data here and there when combined together\nprovide such a piece of meaningful information fascinates me.
